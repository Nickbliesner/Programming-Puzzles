# DataStructures
Implementation of various data structures used to store different kinds of data as well as preserve guranteed properties about the structure  

**KHeap.java**-   Data structure for ints which holds that each value is less than or equal to it's k children (typically 2 - 4 children)

**LinkedIntList.java**-  Data structure which keeps track of a sequential linked list of ints, supports adding, removing, setting and getting

**ListNode.java**-   Node class used by LinkedIntList for an individual node of a linked int list 

**Monarchy.java** - Data structure which represents a monarchy's family tree, members are birthed, die, and the proper succession order is kept track of  

**RoyalNode.java** - Node class used by Monarchy to represent an individual family member in the royal family tree 

**Trie.java**-   Data structure which stores strings in a prefix tree, storing every common prefix only one time, supports adding, removing, and checking if a string is contained or a prefix

**TrieNode.java** - Node class used by Trie to represent an individual node (whether or not it marks the end of a value) in the prefix tree, trie
