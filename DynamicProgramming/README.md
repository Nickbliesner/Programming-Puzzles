# DynamicProgramming
Implementation of dynamic programming to solve various kinds of problems (many optimization) which in themselves require solving sub problems

**Combination.java**-    Finds the number of combinations that can be created by picking m total items from a total of n things 

**Fibonacci.java**-   Finds the nth fibonacci number in various iterative and recursive ways

**FrogJump.java**-   Given a bog (int[]) of jump values finds out the minimum number of hops needed for a frog to cross the bog if it can cross

**NonDecreasingSequences.java** - Given a length m and a number of ints n finds how many nondecreasing sequences (never decrease) can be made of length m, with n distinct ints

**NumberOfBSTS.java** - Finds how many unique binary search trees can be created from n distinct integers

**UniquePaths.java**- Given a grid of dimensions n * m finds how many distinct paths a robot can take to go from the top left to the bottom right corner only moving down and right
