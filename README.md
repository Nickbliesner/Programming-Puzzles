# Programming-Puzzles
Public repository to house my different approaches for many fun and exciting programming related problems!

**DataStructures**- Implementation of various data structures (KHeap, Trie, monarchy/royal family tree, etc.)

**DynamicProgramming** - Applying dynamic programming, solving the problem involves solving similar sub problems etc., to solve interesting math and computing questions (number of unique BST's, Combinations, min prime sum, etc.)

**GreedyAlgorithms**- Implementation of various greedy Algorithms (Dijkstra's, word to word, etc.) which assume at a certain step the optimal one (min or max) will lead to the right solution

**SearchingAlgorithms** - Implementation of various searching algorithms for sorted and unsorted data (linear search, binary search, ternary search, etc.), demonstrated on int[] 's

**SortingAlgorithms** - Implementation of various sorting algorithms (heap sort, quick sort, merge sort, etc...), demonstrated with int[] 's,
