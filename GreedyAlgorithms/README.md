# GreedyAlgorithms
Implementation of various greedy algorithms, algorithms which assume the current optimal step leads to the best optimization

**Dijkstras.java**- Applies Dijkstra's min path algorithm to find the smallest path from a target vertex to all other vertices in a connected, weighted, undirected graph 

**Pair.java**- Data structure used by Djikstra's algorithm to keep track of pairs of vertices as well as distances to those vertices

**WordChange.java**- Determines the minimum number of operations to convert one dictionary word to another, one letter at a time to other valid words  

**WordPair.java**- Data structure used by WordChange to keep track of words as well as the path to them from a starting word/vertex

**dictionary2.txt**- Text file which contains a dictionary of 3 letter words
